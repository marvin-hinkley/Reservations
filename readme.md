- in-memory DB is seeded with one client and one provider:
  - provider id: a06cb0b4-7b9b-423b-96fc-14ff2efa7ce9
  - client id: b385f350-e17a-42df-95ad-1722ae9df831
- assuming provider entering specific availabilities rather than selecting from 15-minute increments
- wasn't able to get to unit testing
    - test basic CRUD
    - test availability conditions
- would rather not use EF. did so for speed and in-memory implementation. would rather have gone postgres + dapper. good news is that it's abstract enough to allow for easy replacement of the repository internals without affecting business logic
- EF usage forces referential integrity checks. would be more performant without them, simply relying on foreign key conditions
- wasn't able to finish containerizing
- the swagger parameter definitions incorrectly read as required in some cases
- reservations are not enforced as 15-minute duration. it's possible to overlap with bad data
- wanted to restrict availability retrieval by provider field and date-time range. both could mitigate performance issues at scale. not enough time
